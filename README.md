This is a [tomo](https://github.com/mattbrictson/tomo) plugin that provides tasks for managing [sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) via [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd), based on the recommendations in the sidekiq documentation. This plugin assumes that you are also using `rbenv` and `env`, and that you are using a systemd-based Linux distribution like Ubuntu 18 LTS.

## Installation

Run:

```
$ gem install tomo-plugin-sidekiq
```

Or add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "tomo-plugin-sidekiq"
```

Then add the following to `.tomo/config.rb`:

```ruby
plugin "sidekiq"

setup do
  # ...
  run "sidekiq:setup_systemd"
end

deploy do
  # ...
  # Place this task at *after* core:symlink_current
  run "sidekiq:restart"
end
```

### enable-linger

This plugin installs sidekiq as a user-level service using systemctl --user. This allows sidekiq to be installed, started, stopped, and restarted without a root user or sudo. However, when provisioning the host you must make sure to run the following command as root to allow the sidekiq process to continue running even after the tomo deploy user disconnects:

```
# run as root
$ loginctl enable-linger <DEPLOY_USER>
```
