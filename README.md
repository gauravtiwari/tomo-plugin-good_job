This is a [tomo](https://github.com/mattbrictson/tomo) plugin that provides tasks for managing [good_job](https://github.com/bensheldon/good_job) via [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd), based on the recommendations in the good_job documentation. This plugin assumes that you are also using the tomo `rbenv` and `env` plugins, and that you are using a systemd-based Linux distribution like Ubuntu 18 LTS.

## Installation

Run:

```
$ gem install tomo-plugin-good_job
```

Or add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "tomo-plugin-good_job"
```

Then add the following to `.tomo/config.rb`:

```ruby
plugin "good_job"

setup do
  # ...
  run "good_job:setup_systemd"
end

deploy do
  # ...
  # Place this task at *after* core:symlink_current
  run "good_job:restart"
end
```

### enable-linger

This plugin installs good_job as a user-level service using systemctl --user. This allows good_job to be installed, started, stopped, and restarted without a root user or sudo. However, when provisioning the host you must make sure to run the following command as root to allow the good_job process to continue running even after the tomo deploy user disconnects:

```
# run as root
$ loginctl enable-linger <DEPLOY_USER>
```

## Tasks

### good_job:setup_systemd

Configures systemd to manage good_job. This means that good_job will automatically be restarted if it crashes, or if the host is rebooted. This task essentially does two things:

1. Installs a `good_job.service` systemd unit
1. Enables it using `systemctl --user enable`

Note that these units will be installed and run for the deploy user. You can use `:good_job_systemd_service_template_path` to provide your own template and customize how good_job and systemd are configured.

`good_job:setup_systemd` is intended for use as a [setup](https://tomo-deploy.com/commands/setup/) task. It must be run before good_job can be started during a deploy.

### good_job:restart

Gracefully restarts the good_job service via systemd, or starts it if it isn't running already. Equivalent to:

```
systemctl --user restart good_job.service
```

### good_job:start

Starts the good_job service via systemd, if it isn't running already. Equivalent to:

```
systemctl --user start good_job.service
```

### good_job:stop

Stops the good_job service via systemd. Equivalent to:

```
systemctl --user stop good_job.service
```

### good_job:status

Prints the status of the good_job systemd service. Equivalent to:

```
systemctl --user status good_job.service
```

### good_job:log

Uses `journalctl` (part of systemd) to view the log output of the good_job service. This task is intended for use as a [run](https://tomo-deploy.com/commands/run/) task and accepts command-line arguments. The arguments are passed through to the `journalctl` command. For example:

```
$ tomo run -- good_job:log -f
```

Will run this remote script:

```
journalctl -q --user-unit=good_job.service -f
```
